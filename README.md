# Shebang for Windows

Run Linux-style scripts on Windows with their native shebang interpreters!

![Demo](demo.gif)

## What is Shebang?

Did you ever wish you could run some of your `.py` scripts on Windows with `uv run`, and some of them with `python.exe`? Or maybe you want to run `.sh` scripts with `bash.exe`? 

Associate any file extension on Windows with `shebang.exe`, and it will look at the Linux-style shebang at the top of the file to run that file however you want. Let the file itself decide how it should be run. This will allow you to use exactly the same scripts on Linux and Windows, with no modifications.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Cross-platform script execution** - Use the same scripts on Linux and Windows without changes
- ðŸŽ¯ **Shebang interpreter** - Reads and respects the shebang line (`#!`) at the top of your scripts
- ðŸ”§ **Flexible execution** - Supports various interpreters like Python, UV, Bash, Node.js, etc.
- ðŸ“¦ **Zero configuration** - Just associate file extensions with shebang.exe
- ðŸªŸ **Windows-optimized** - Handles `/usr/bin/env` shebangs gracefully on Windows

## How It Works

1. You associate script file extensions (`.py`, `.sh`, etc.) with `shebang.exe` in Windows
2. When you double-click or run a script, Windows calls `shebang.exe` with the script path
3. Shebang reads the first line of your script (the shebang line)
4. It parses the interpreter command and executes your script with the correct program

## Examples

### Python Script with UV
```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script --quiet
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.8"
# dependencies = [
#     "click",
# ]
# ///
print('hello')
```

### Regular Python Script
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, World!')
```

### Bash Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running on Windows with bash.exe!"
```

## Installation

1. Download or build `shebang.exe`
2. Place it in a directory in your PATH (or remember its location)
3. Associate file extensions with shebang.exe:
   - Right-click on a `.py` file â†’ "Open with" â†’ "Choose another app"
   - Browse to `shebang.exe` and select it
   - Check "Always use this app to open .py files"
   - Repeat for other extensions (`.sh`, `.rb`, etc.)

## Building from Source

Requirements:
- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

```bash
cd shebang
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be in `target/release/shebang.exe`

## Supported Shebang Formats

- `#!/usr/bin/env python` - Standard env shebang
- `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` - Env with options
- `#!/usr/bin/python` - Direct interpreter path
- `#!/bin/bash` - Shell scripts
- Any other valid shebang line!

## How Shebang Handles Arguments

The program correctly handles:
- Shebang arguments (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/python -u`)
- Script arguments passed when running the script
- Special `--` separator for argument ordering control

## Troubleshooting

### "No shebang line found" Error
Make sure your script starts with `#!` on the very first line.

### "Failed to execute command" Error
Ensure the interpreter specified in your shebang line is installed and in your PATH.

### Scripts open in text editor instead
You need to associate the file extension with `shebang.exe` rather than your text editor.
